# Elite-Dangerous-Manual
Historical collection of old versions of the Game Manual.

As the game changes, so does the manual. Frontier only hosts the latest copy, so older versions are inaccessible. This repository was created to maintain a collection of the previous versions.

This is not an official repository. A script downloads the latest version of the full and quick manual every day and saves them if a change is detected. If Frontier publishes a version and quickly replaces it with an update within the same day, the script may not refresh quickly enough to catch both copies.

Even if there isn't any important historical significance, it can still be fun just to look back at old manuals to see how the game has progressed.
